Text Mining: Sentiment analysis of Text and Audio
============
####Approaches Used:
 - Text Classification with Naive Bayes.
 - Bag of Words Representation.
 
####About Application:
 - We have developed a java application
 - Input:
    - Audio (real-time or recorded speech)
    - Text
 - Output
    - Sentiments

####Input Supported:
 - Text: Document in .pdf or .doc supported
   - Size: one to two pages
   - We need to work on algorithm to support huge articles
 - Sound: 
   - Recorded sound of .wav format are excepted
   - We can record sound using our application
   - Google Sound to Text API used using REST full call to Google server by java
   - Length of audio is limited support 5 to 10 min
